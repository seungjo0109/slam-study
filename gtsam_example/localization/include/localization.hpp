#include <gtsam/geometry/Pose2.h>

// We will use simple integer Keys to refer to the robot poses.
#include <gtsam/inference/Key.h>

// As in OdometryExample.cpp, we use a BetweenFactor to model odometry measurements.
#include <gtsam/slam/BetweenFactor.h>

// We add all facors to a Nonlinear Factor Graph, as our factors are nonlinear.
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/NonlinearFactorGraph.h>

// The nonlinear solvers within GTSAM are iterative solvers, meaning they linearize the
// nonlinear functions around an initial linearization point, then solve the linear system
// to update the linearization point. This happens repeatedly until the solver converges
// to a consistent set of variable values. This requires us to specify an initial guess
// for each variable, held in a Values container.
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/Values.h>

// Finally, once all of the factors have been added to our factor graph, we will want to
// solve/optimize to graph to find the best (Maximum A Posteriori) set of variable values.
// GTSAM includes several nonlinear optimizers to perform this step. Here we will use the
// standard Levenberg-Marquardt solver
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer.h>

// Once the optimized values have been calculated, we can also calculate the marginal covariance
// of desired variables
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/Marginals.h>

// Before we begin the example, we must create a custom unary factor to implement a
// "GPS-like" functionality. Because standard GPS measurements provide information
// only on the position, and not on the orientation, we cannot use a simple prior to
// properly model this measurement.
//
// The factor will be a unary factor, affect only a single system variable. It will
// also use a standard Gaussian noise model. Hence, we will derive our new factor from
// the NoiseModelFactor1.

  // Using the NoiseModelFactor1 base class there are two functions that must be overridden.
  // The first is the 'evaluateError' function. This function implements the desired measurement
  // function, returning a vector of errors when evaluated at the provided variable value. It
  // must also calculate the Jacobians for this measurement function, if requested.
  Vector evaluateError(const Pose2& q, boost::optional<Matrix&> H = boost::none) const override {
    // The measurement function for a GPS-like measurement h(q) which predicts the measurement (m) is h(q) = q, q = [qx qy qtheta]
    // The error is then simply calculated as E(q) = h(q) - m:
    // error_x = q.x - mx
    // error_y = q.y - my
    // Node's orientation reflects in the Jacobian, in tangent space this is equal to the right-hand rule rotation matrix
    // H =  [ cos(q.theta)  -sin(q.theta) 0 ]

    return (Vector(2) << q.x() - mx_, q.y() - my_).finished();

  // (as all GTSAM factors are), in which you would need an equals and print, to satisfy the
  // GTSAM_CONCEPT_TESTABLE_INST(T) defined in Testable.h, but these are not needed below.
