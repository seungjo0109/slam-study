## g2o Data Fitting
* In this repository, threre is an example of g2o circle data fitting.
* This project referenced the following repository(https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o/blob/master/g2o/examples/data_fitting/circle_fit.cpp)
* In this example, optimization is performed using the __Levenberg-Marquardt__ algorithm. Through optimization, we estimate the radius and center point of true circle.

## Requirements
* This implementation was done using:
    * Ubuntu 20.04
    * g2o library
    * Eigen

</br>
